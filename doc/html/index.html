<p>The code also comes with a "good will only" support: feel free to contact us for any comments/critics/bug report/request help you may have, we will be happy to try to answer and help you. But we cannot spend much time solving your problems, just the time to read a couple of e-mails and send you fast suggestions if the problem is easily solvable.

Package description</h2>
<p>This release comes out with the following files:</p>
<ul>
<li><b><a class="el" href="CQKnPClass_8h.html" title="Definition of the abstract base class CQKnPClass, which implements a standard interface for Continuou...">CQKnPClass.h</a>:</b> Contains the declaration of class <code>CQKnPClass</code>. It is an <em>abstract class</em> with <em>pure virtual methods</em>, so that you cannot declare objects of type <code>CQKnPClass</code>, but only of derived classes of its. <code>CQKnPClass</code> offers a general interface for CQKnP solver codes, with methods for setting and reading the data of the problems, for solving it and retrieving solution informations, and so on. The actual CQKnP solvers distributed in this package conforms with the interface, i.e., they derive from <code>CQKnPClass</code>; however, the idea is that applications using this interface would require almost no changes if any other solvers implementing the interface is used. Carefully read the public interface of the class to understand how to use the public methods of the class.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b><a class="el" href="CQKnPClone_8h.html" title="Definition of implementation of the template class CQKnPClone.">CQKnPClone/CQKnPClone.h</a></b>: Contains the declarations of class <code><a class="el" href="classCQKnPClone.html" title="Class for cross-testing solvers of the Continuous Quadratic Knapsack Problem implemented as derived o...">CQKnPClone</a></code>, implementing a "fake" CQKnP solver that takes two "real" ones and does everything on both; useful for testing the solvers (either for correctness or for efficiency) when used within "complex" approaches</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>CQKnPClone/makefile</b>: "recursive" makefile for the <code><a class="el" href="classCQKnPClone.html" title="Class for cross-testing solvers of the Continuous Quadratic Knapsack Problem implemented as derived o...">CQKnPClone</a></code> class, see lib and extlib below</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b><a class="el" href="CQKnPCplex_8h.html" title="Continuous Quadratic Knapsack Problems (CQKnP) solver based on calls to the CPLEX callable library...">CQKnPCplex/CQKnPCplex.h</a></b>: Contains the declarations of class <code>CQKnPCplex</code>, implementing a CQKnP solver conforming to the <code>CQKnPClass</code> interface based on calls to the commercial (but now free for academic purposes) <code>Cplex</code> solver from IBM. You need to separately obtain a <code>Cplex</code> distribution and link it with this code (see QKnPCplex/makefile below) to make it work. This does not make much of a sense in that <code>Cplex</code> is far slower than the other options, unless one is interested in checking correctness and efficiency of some CQKnP solver.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>CQKnPCplex/CQKnPCplex.C</b>: Contains the implementation of the <code>CQKnPCplex</code> class. You should not need to read it.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>CQKnPCplex/makefile</b>: "recursive" makefile for the <code>CQKnPCplex</code> class, see lib and extlib below</li>

<li><b><a class="el" href="DualCQKnP_8h.html" title="Basis Continuous Quadratic Knapsack Problems (CQKnP) solver based on the standard dual-ascent approac...">DualCQKnP/DualCQKnP.h</a></b>: Contains the declarations of class <code>DualCQKnP</code>, implementing a CQKnP solver based on the standard dual-ascent approach. This class derives from <code>CQKnPClass</code>, hence most of its interface is defined and discussed in <a class="el" href="CQKnPClass_8h.html" title="Definition of the abstract base class CQKnPClass, which implements a standard interface for Continuou...">CQKnPClass.h</a>; however, for efficiency it is actually restricted to instances where <em>all</em> items have <em>strictly positive quadratic costs</em> and <em>finite bounds</em> (both lower and upper), so in fact it does not fully implement the interface. Furthermore, a few implementation-dependent details (and compile-time switches) which are worth knowing are described in this file.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>DualCQKnP/DualCQKnP.C</b>: Contains the implementation of the <code>DualCQKnP</code> class. You should not need to read it.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>DualCQKnP/makefile</b>: Makefile for the <code>DualCQKnP</code> class.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b><a class="el" href="ExDualCQKnP_8h.html" title="Continuous Quadratic Knapsack Problems (CQKnP) solver based on the standard dual-ascent approach...">ExDualCQKnP/ExDualCQKnP.h</a></b>: Contains the declarations of class <code>ExDualCQKnP</code>, derived from <code>DualCQKnP</code> (and hence from <code>CQKnPClass</code>) and extending it to support all the features of the problem (possibly zero quadratic costs, possibly infinite upper and lower bounds). It is slightly less efficient, so <code>DualCQKnP</code> should be preferred for the instances that it can solve.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>ExDualCQKnP/ExDualCQKnP.C</b>: Contains the implementation of the <code>ExDualCQKnP</code> class. You should not need to read it.</li>

<ul>
<li><b>ExDualCQKnP/makefile</b>: Makefile for the <code>ExDualCQKnP</code> class.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>extlib/makefile-libCPX</b>: the makefile where Cplex path libraries are declared, edit it to insert your own</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>lib/*</b>: Makefiles for creating the libCQK.a library file to be linked by the code using it (in this case the main files in the Main directory); in particular, makefile-o is where the modules that will be part of the library are decided (<code>CQKnPCplex</code> comes commented out by default)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Main/Main.C</b>: Contains an example of use of the provided CQKnP solvers: creates pne of them (according to the some macros) and use it to solve a chosen instance read from file.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Main/MainRnd.C</b>: Contains an example of use of the provided CQKnP solvers: creates two of them (according to the some macros) and use them to solve a slew of randomly-generated instances, checking that the results agree (and comparing the running times).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Main/makefile</b>: A makefile for Main.C and MainRnd.C. You can easily decide which Main file to use, while in order to decide which solvers will be in the library you have to work with lib/makefile-o; of course you have to be careful to include these required according to the macro settings in Main[Rnd].C (assuming you care anything about these main files, which is unclear why you should).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Main\tests\rnd.sh</b>: Script file for using MainRnd.C.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Main\tests\spp.sh</b>: Script file for using Main.C together with the generator of one-dimensional Sensor Placement Problems that can be found at  <a href="http://www.di.unipi.it/optimize/Data/RDR.html">http://www.di.unipi.it/optimize/Data/RDR.html</a> </li>
